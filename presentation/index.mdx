# Guarding your application from run-time null reference errors

---

### We devote way too much code guarding against nulls

<!--
  Null reference (or null pointer) expections, a.k.a. the
  'Billion Dollar Mistake'. We're devoting far too much time
  handling or guarding against null or undefined values in
  our Javscript code.

### `if..else` statements

```javascript
let getName = function(person) {
  if (person.name) {
    return person.name;
  } else {
    return undefined;
  }
};

getName({ name: "John" }); // -> 'John'
getName(); // -> undefined
```

<!---
  I'm sure we're all familiar with code like this...
-->

---

### 'and' `&&` expression short-circuiting

```javascript
let getName = function(person) {
  return person && person.name;
};

getName({ name: "John" }); // -> 'John'
getName(); // -> undefined
```

<!---
  ...or this
-->

---

### Ternary expressions

```javascript
let printName = function(name) {
  name ? console.log(name) : undefined;
};

printName("John"); // -> 'John'
printName(); // -> undefined
```

<!--
  ...or event like this
-->

---

### What if we could write a data structure to handle null checking for us?

<!--
  Other than the extra code we have to write to accomodate
  for null/undefined values in our model, we're often times
  just kicking the proverbial null-can down the road, or in
  this case to the next client of our nullable value.

  This, of course, should probably be enforced by some sort
  of anti-corruption layer that enforces the invariants of
  the domain you're modeling. But in large applications
  this might not be as obvious or foolproof
-->

<!--
  Since we're dealing with javascript, we can enforce that
  null cases are always handled, but we can ensure that if
  they're not we are notified as close to app start as possible
-->

---

### What should our api look like?

<!--
  The javascript spec already provides a structure that does
  something very similiar -- Promises
-->

---

export default CodeSlide;

```javascript
const maybeName = maybePromise(someObject.name)
  .then(toUpperCase)
  .then(logToConsole)
  .catch(() => {
    throw new Error("no name");
  });
```

<!--
  A javscript promise wraps a value and accepts two
  callbacks which allow us to specify what should happen once
  that value is fulfilled or rejected. If it's fulfilled,
  the assocated 'then' handler is called with that resolved
  value. If it's rejected, the 'catch' handlered is called.

  This is pretty close, but since the intention for promises
  was as a way act as a proxy from async values, the client
  api is a bit weird.
-->

---

### Our very own custom data structure

<!--
  What if we could make our own datastructor with the same
  semantics as Promises, but instead are meant to be
  evaluated synchronously?
-->

---

export default CodeSlide;

```javascript
function getName(person) {
  return new Maybe(person.name)
    .map((person) => person.name));
}

class Maybe {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val
  }
  map(fn) {
    if (!this.val) {
      return maybe(null)
    } else {
      return maybe(fn(val))
    }
  }
}
```

<!--
  In this snippet, we have a structure that does just that:
  wraps a nullable value and provides us an api to operate
  on it in a such a way that guarantees that we never have
  to worry about whether or not the initial expression/value
  was null.

  In this example, we can think of 'map' as our version of
  'Promise.prototype.then', this is a method that only
  invokes it's provided callback when the Promise is
  fulfilled. In our case, map only invokes it's callback
  when the wrapped value is not null.
-->

---

export default CodeSlide;

```javascript
const maybeHelloWorld = new Maybe("Hello")
  .map(str => str.toUpper())
  .map(str => null)
  .map(str => str.concat(" ")) // Never called!
  .map(str => str.concat("WORLD!")); // Never called, either!
```

<!--
  One cool thing about this is that if you
  chain together multiple maps, any operation in the
  sequence after a null value is never evaluated and skipped
  over entirely! The shortcircuiting is built into the data
  structure itself.
-->

---

export default CodeSlide;

```javascript
// safeGetName :: object -> Maybe(string)
const safeGetName = person => new Maybe(person.name);
// toUpper :: Maybe(string) -> Maybe(string)
const toUpper = maybeName => maybeName.map(name => name.toUpper());
// safeNameToUpper :: object -> Maybe(string)
const safeNameToUpper = person => toUpper(safeGetName(person));
```

<!--
  One of the benefits of our structure is that it composes
  really nicely. Once we have our wrapped value we can
  safely compose it with other functions that deal with our
  wrapped Maybe values without any additional `null`
  checking. If any value in the chain resolves to null, it
  propogates up automatically.

  The issue, as you can here,
  is that all of the functions in the composition chain.
  need to know how to deal with our maybe function. What if
  we wanted to combine to functions that return maybe?
-->

---

export default CodeSlide;

```javascript
// safeGetName :: object -> Maybe(string)
const safeGetName = person => new Maybe(person.name);
// safeToUpper :: string -> Maybe(string)
const safeToUpper = string => new Maybe(string.toUpper());
// safeNameToUpper :: object -> Maybe(Maybe(string))
const safeNameToUpper = person =>
  safeGetName(person).map(name => safeToUpper(name));

// safeNameToUpper === Maybe(Maybe(string))
```

<!--
Yuck. Since we're dealing with two different functions that
make our values safe, it becomes quite difficult to deal
with them. Having to manually string together these values
is tedious and leads to a lot of the same issues we were
trying to solve in the first place: Wasting precious
keystrokes to handle null values. We can't expect developers
to peel back the layers of that onion manually.
-->

---

### Chaining our Maybes

<!--
Let's add a method to our data structure that can handle
this unwrapping for us!
-->

---

export default CodeSlide;

```javascript
class Maybe {
  //...
  join() {
    return val ? val : new Maybe(null);
  }

  chain(fn) {
    if (!val) {
      return new Maybe(null);
    } else {
      return fn(val).join();
    }
  }
}
```

<!--
  This is a lot of un-wrap(lol) but let's walk through,
  line-by-line what's happening here. We've got a brand new
  method called `chain` here that is basically just `map`
  with a `join` tacked on to the end to do the unwrapping
  for us.
-->

---

```javascript
// safeGetName :: object -> Maybe(string)
const safeGetName = person => new Maybe(person.name);
// safeToUpper :: string -> Maybe(string)
const safeToUpper = string => new Maybe(string.toUpper());

// safeNameToUpper :: object -> Maybe(string)
const safeNameToUpper = person =>
  safeGetName(person).chain(name => safeToUpper(name));
```

<!--
Now we don't need to worry about unwrapping all our wrapped
values each time we want to compose our wrapped values!
Note that `then` in Promise.prototype does this smooshing
for us automagically
-->

```
function invariant(exp, msg) {
if (!expression) throw new Error(msg);
}
```
